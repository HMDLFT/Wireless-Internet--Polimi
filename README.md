    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        In this report, we analyzed the MAC randomization behavior in Wi-Fi probe requests of the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Xiaomi 11T Pro devices. Using a sniffer in monitor mode and Wireshark, we captured and examined probe request packets in different scenarios. Through a sniffing and filtering procedure, we explored the patterns and variations in MAC randomization for both devices. The findings offer valuable insights into the privacy protection mechanisms employed by these devices during Wi-Fi connections.

        In the context of Wi-Fi connections, stations send probe requests to access points (APs) to connect to a certain network and gain access to it. These probe requests generally include unencrypted information, such as a randomized Media Access Control (MAC) address, to protect user privacy. Understanding the MAC randomization behavior of devices is crucial for evaluating their effectiveness in safeguarding user identities. This report aims to characterize the MAC randomization behavior of iPhone 15 Pro and Xiaomi 11T Pro 5G devices through an analysis of their Wi-Fi probe requests.
